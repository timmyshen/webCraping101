5	PB&amp;L	Publican Qualty Meats	When this place opened in February, it quickly rose to the top tier with its refined roster of sandwiches.

13	The Hawkeye	Frog n Snail	We didn’t expect a <em>Man v. Food–</em>esque behemoth on Dale Levitski’s menu, but there it was: a shiny egg bun dripping grease from its delectable pan-fried and ground pork innards. And ten minutes later, there it wasn’t.	$14.	3124 N. Broadway	773-661-9166	frognsnail.com

17	Corned Beef	Manny’s	The most famous deli sandwich in Chicago is also the gold standard: a sliced-to-order spectacle of salty-sweet meat that’s so tender, juicy, and lean you’ll savor it, sans the mild rye or the mustard, using only your fork.	$11.95.	1141 S. Jefferson St.	312-939-2855	mannysdeli.com

23	Toasted Pimiento Cheese	Big Jones	Not the gooiest but definitely the kickiest grilled cheese around, thanks to the genius who thought to melt local heirloom pimientos right into the tangy cheddar.

Clark St.	773-275-5725	bigjoneschicago.com

Multiple locations	"<a href=""http://pastoralartisan.com/"">pastoralartisan.com</a>"	pastoralartisan.com
26	Pastrami	Max’s Deli	Pastrami is the bacon of deli meats—a succulent, salty guilty pleasure that’s rarely described as lean.

And the juice from the warm meat soaks into the chewy rye bread.	$11.95.	191 Skokie Valley Rd.	Highland Park	maxs-deli.com
27	The Fredo	Lucky’s Sandwich Co.	This hulk—which stacks copious amounts of coleslaw and salty skin-on fries over layers of Italian deli meats and cold provolone on white—admits very few to the Clean Plate Club.	$7.50.

31	Serrano ham and Manchego cheese	Hannah’s Bretzel	A perpetually jammed workday lunch stop has no right turning out such beautifully marbled sliced-to-order ham.

Multiple locations	"<a href=""http://hannahsbretzel.com/"">hannahsbretzel.com</a>"	hannahsbretzel.com
32	Tuna Salad	La Fournette	Pierre Zimmermann claims to be a fourth-generation French baker.

35	B.A.D.	Floriole Cafe &amp; Bakery	The silky smooth almond-date spread makes this a standout. No, wait, it’s that perfect bacon.

36	Duck Confit and Mozzarella	First Slice Pie Café	Duck is not your typical sandwich meat, but First Slice’s panino—a wonderland of blistery mozzarella, mushrooms, grilled red onions, and sun-dried tomato spread—overflows with hunks and slivers of duck confit. Ethereal and glorious.	$9.	5357 N. Ashland Ave.	773-275-4297	firstslice.org
37	Croque Monsieur	Troquet	Not fair that Parisians are so famously skinny, with grilled cheese like this at their disposal—hefty with ham, oozy with Swiss and béchamel, a feast on crusty sourdough bread. With frites, bien sûr.	$8.	1834 W. Montrose Ave.	773-334-5664	troquetchicago.com
38	Green Garbanzo	Grahamwich	With chewy strips of preserved lemon rind, moist couscous studded with bright garbanzo beans and pine nuts, and a squishy flatbread encasement, this vegetarian pick has serious star power.

Multiple locations	"<a href=""http://saigonsisters.com"">saigonsisters.com</a>"	saigonsisters.com
40	Tuscan Chicken	Rosalia’s Tuscan Chicken	When a boneless chicken breast is dripping with jus, somebody did something right.

41	The Marty	Z&amp;H MarketCafe	The generous application of muhammara—a zesty Middle Eastern spread involving peppers, ground walnuts, and pomegranate molasses—elevates this panino of grilled eggplant and tomatoes with Muenster cheese on herbed focaccia.	$7.25.	1323 E. 57th St.	773-538-7372	zhmarketcafe.com
42	Whitefish	Market House on the Square	Could a sandwich sound more unsexy? Hardly. But this thick, juicy breaded fillet—all dolled up with sweet chili vinaigrette, shallots, and basil—is a player. Ditto for the irresistible fries.	$11.	655 Forest Ave.	Lake Forest	themarkethouse.com
43	Oat Bread, Pecan Butter,	Elaine’s Coffee Call	The chalkboard menu is ambiguous about whether this pressed-to-order snack (in which housemade jam crafted from Green City Market fruit seeps from between freshly baked oat bread) is meant for breakfast or lunch, so we’ll just order it every time we’re in the neighborhood.	$6.	Hotel Lincoln	1816 N. Clark St.	jdvhotels.com/hotels/chicago/lincoln
44	Cauliflower Melt	Marion Street Cheese Market	Who says veggie sandwiches are healthy? This beefy number is indulgent and delightfully greasy.

45	Cubano	Cafecito	The success of this sandwich, a Cuban tradition with shredded pork, glazed ham, Swiss cheese, yellow mustard, and pickles, rests with the bread.

46	Kufta	Chickpea	Nestled within the freshest, chewiest pita pocket our teeth have ever met, twin logs of impeccably spiced ground lamb and beef mingle with grill-marked tomatoes, green peppers, and onions.

47	Debbie’s Egg Salad	The Goddess and Grocer	Nothing quite satisfies the comfortfood hunger like some unfussy egg salad on multigrain toast.

Broadway	773-868-4000	phoebesbakery.com
